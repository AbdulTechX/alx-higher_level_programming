# 0x10. Python - Network #0

In this networking project, I used curl in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/repsonse header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the overall project theme completed in Python.
